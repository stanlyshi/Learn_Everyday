Introduction
The three types of IPC,
	Posix message queues (Chapter 5),
	Posix semaphores (Chapter lo), and
	Posix shared memory (Chapter 13)
	are collectively referred to as "Posix IPC." They share some similarities in the functions
	that access them, and in the information that describes them. This chapter describes all
	these common properties: the pathnames used for identification, the flags specified
	when opening or creating, and the access permissions.
