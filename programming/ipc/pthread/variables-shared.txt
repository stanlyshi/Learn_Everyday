More than just the global variables are shared. All threads within a process share the following:
• Process instructions
• Most data
• Open files (e.g., descriptors)
• Signal handlers and signal dispositions
• Current working directory
• User and group IDs

But each thread has its own
• Thread ID
• Set of registers, including program counter and stack pointer
• Stack (for local variables and return addresses)
• errno
• Signal mask
• Priority
