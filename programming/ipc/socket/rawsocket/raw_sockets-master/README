-------------------------- Assignment-------------------------------
1. Write a program using Raw Socket (Packet Socket) of Linux  e  nvironment that reads the packets at the 2nd Layer (of the OSI model) and reports whenever a new Ethernet station is identified in the network.
Please read the online manual entries for the following.
            Socket (2)
            Socket (7)
            Packet(7)
            and related ones (see also ports).

2.Site to filter the receive packets in data link layer

http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/hardy/man7/packet.7.html

Details for the same:

Valid types are PACKET_HOST for a packet addressed to the local host, PACKET_BROADCAST for a physical layer broadcast packet, PACKET_MULTICAST for a packet sent to a physical layer multicast address, PACKET_OTHERHOST for a packet to some other host that has been caught by a device driver in promiscuous mode, and PACKET_OUTGOING for a packet originated from the local host that is looped back to a packet socket. These types make only sense for receiving.

{
// these constant values are taken from linux/if_packet.h
case 0://PACKET_HOST
             printf("For_Me\n");
             break;
case 1://PACKET_BROADCAST
             printf("Broadcast\n");
             break;
case 2://PACKET_MULTICAST
             printf("Multicast\n");
             break;
case 3://PACKET_OTHERHOST
          printf("Other_Host\n");
          break;
case 4://PACKET_OUTGOING
          printf("Outgoing\n");
          break;
case 5://PACKET_LOOPBACK
          printf("Loop_Back\n");
          break;
case 6://PACKET_FASTROUTE
          printf("Fast_Route\n");
          break;
}
